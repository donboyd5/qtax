# qtax

This package contains historical and recent state government quarterly tax data, from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Eventually, I will integrate it with Lucy Dadayan's quarterly tax data for recent years, which is much more reliable than the Census Bureau's data, but has fewer tax elements.

Install it from github with:
  
```{r}
devtools::install_github("donboyd5/qtax")
```
